# Domain-Driven Design in Symfony

A repository to bring DDD concepts to life in the format of a realistic Symfony based project.

As an example, in this repository we will explore what a Doctors Surgery Application may look like when implemented using
DDD.

## Motivation

There are a load of DDD resources out there, but often I find it's not until you begin to apply this learning to real-world
challenges that they really start to take root. My aim is to use this repository to house a realistic, simple (at least 
to start with) Symfony-based file structure, which adheres to DDD. Once a first draft has been produced, it can be used
as a basis for conversations with fellow developers. I'll use these conversations to evolve my understanding on the topic,
keeping this repository updated.

I'm also hoping that as I build this repository up over time, adding my thoughts / opinions / links to reading materials
that it can be used as a sort of cheat-sheet for developers who are new to DDD and would benefit from seeing how
DDD can be applied to a Symfony based project.

## Disclaimers

- Even within the DDD community, there are differences in opinion when it comes to implementation of the various concepts. How far you take DDD depends on whether the benefits outweigh the overhead. This implementation aims to strike this balance for a simple Symfony application
- I'm still figuring some of this out, it's a work in progress, so please don't view this as a finished product!
